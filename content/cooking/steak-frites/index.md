## Food for Thought 🍪
This recipe was just okay. It was a pretty simple recipe, but I didn't think the recipe was that good.
The sauce didn't really taste right, and wasn't the right color. The steak and fries were good, but
they weren't really part of the recipe haha.

## Making the Recipe
Making the recipe went pretty smoothly, but we couldn't get the sauce very smooth with just my blender.
Having something like an immersion blender would have helped here.
